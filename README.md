## LibDriver SGP40

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/sgp40/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The SGP40 is a digital gas sensor designed for easy integration into air purifier s or demand controlled ventilation systems. Sensirion’s CMOSens ® technology offers a complete , easy to use sensor system on a single chip featuring a digital I 2 C interface and a temperature controlled micro hotplate, providing a humidity compensated VOC based indoor air quality signal . The output signal can be directly processed by Sensirion’s powerful Gas Index Algorithm to translate the raw signal into a VOC Index as a robust measure for in door air quality. The Gas Index Algorithm automatically adapts to the environment the sensor is exposed to. Both sensing element and Gas Index Algorithm feature an unmatched robustness against contaminating gases present in real world applications enabling a unique long term stability as well as low drift and device to device variation. The very small 2.44 x 2.44 x 0.85 mm 3 DFN package enables applications in limited spaces. Sensirion’s state of the art production process guarantees high reproducibility and reliability. Tape and reel packaging together with suitability for standard SMD assembly processes make the SGP40 predestined for high volume applications.

LibDriver SGP40 is a full-featured driver of SGP40 launched by LibDriver.It provides VOC reading, temperature and humidity correction and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver SGP40 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver SGP40 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver SGP40 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver SGP40 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver SGP40 offline document.

/datasheet includes SGP40 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_sgp40_basic.h"

float temp = 25.0f;
int32_t voc_gas_index;

/* init */
res = sgp40_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    /* delay 1000ms */
    sgp40_interface_delay_ms(1000);

    /* read data */
    res = sgp40_basic_read(temp, rh, &voc_gas_index);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)sgp40_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    return 1;
}

...
    
/* deinit */
